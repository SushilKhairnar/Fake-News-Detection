# Toxic Comment Classification

This project uses machine learning to classify text data (e.g., comments or news articles) as toxic or non-toxic.  
The dataset is preprocessed using TF-IDF vectorization, and a Passive Aggressive Classifier is trained for binary classification.  
Performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and a classification report.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy
- TfidfVectorizer, PassiveAggressiveClassifier

## How to Run
1. Place `fake.csv` in your project directory.
2. Run the script: `python Toxic_Comment_Classification.py`
